# Sales-Performance-Dashboard

I created an engaging sales performance dashboard that brings clarity to your overall sales, regional trends, and profit. By combining key metrics like total profit, sales by category, and monthly trends, I built a tool that paints a full picture of your performance. I added user-friendly filters for customer type, payment method, and region so that your team can easily dive into the data and make well-informed decisions. Through intuitive visual analytics, the dashboard highlights insights such as regional performance, top-performing managers, and order status distribution. This human-centric, data-driven approach has been instrumental in enhancing your strategic planning and optimizing sales operations.
